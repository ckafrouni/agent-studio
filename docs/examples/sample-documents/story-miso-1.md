# The Adventures of Miso

## Story 1: Miso and the Midnight Garden

Miso awoke with a start. The clock on the wall read 3:17 AM, but something had pulled him from his dreams. A soft blue light filtered through his bedroom curtains—not the harsh white of streetlamps or the yellow of passing cars, but something... different.

Curiosity overcame caution as Miso slipped from beneath his warm blankets. The wooden floor creaked beneath his feet as he padded to the window and pulled back the curtain.

His backyard had transformed. Where his mother's vegetable garden once stood, luminescent flowers now bloomed, casting that ethereal blue glow. The plants seemed to sway despite the still night air.

"I must be dreaming," Miso whispered, but the cool glass against his fingertips felt too real.

Without a second thought, he threw on his slippers and crept downstairs, careful not to wake his parents. The back door opened without a sound—unusual for its typically stubborn hinges.

As Miso stepped into the garden, the flowers turned toward him like curious faces. A narrow path appeared between the stems, beckoning him forward.

"Hello?" he called softly.

A melodic hum answered, rising from the garden itself. The flowers began to sing—not with words, but with feelings that Miso somehow understood. They sang of moonlight and deep earth, of rain and growth and patience.

Miso sat cross-legged among them, listening to their stories until dawn threatened the horizon. As the first rays of sunlight touched the garden, the blue glow faded, and the flowers retreated into ordinary plants.

When his mother found him asleep among her tomato plants that morning, Miso simply smiled. Some secrets were meant to be kept, but he would return to the garden the next night, and the night after that—for those who listen carefully can always find magic in ordinary places.
