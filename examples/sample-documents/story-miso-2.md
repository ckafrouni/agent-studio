## Story 2: Miso and the Forgotten Library

The old bookshop on Maple Street had always been there, at least as far as Miso could remember. But today, something was different. The usually dusty windows gleamed, and the faded "CLOSED" sign had been flipped to "OPEN" for the first time in years.

Miso pressed his face against the glass, peering inside. Shelves upon shelves of books stretched farther back than seemed possible for such a narrow storefront.

The door swung open before he could knock.

"I've been expecting you," said an elderly woman with silver hair and eyes that sparkled like polished coins. "Come in, Miso."

"How do you know my name?" Miso asked, stepping cautiously over the threshold.

The woman smiled mysteriously. "The books told me, of course. They've been waiting for a new Keeper."

"A Keeper?"

"Someone who remembers the stories others forget." She gestured toward the endless rows of books. "This is the Forgotten Library. Every book here contains a story that has slipped from the world's memory."

Miso ran his fingers along the spines of nearby books. Each one seemed to hum beneath his touch.

"Why me?" he asked.

"Because you still believe in the impossible," she replied. "And because you listen—truly listen—when others speak."

She placed a small golden key in his palm. "This opens the Reading Room. One hour each day, you may read from any book. But remember—once read, you become the story's guardian. Its memory lives in you."

For the next year, Miso visited the library daily. He read tales of cloud cities and underwater civilizations, of talking animals and silent humans, of worlds where music was visible and colors had taste.

With each story, Miso changed. His eyes grew deeper, his words more thoughtful. He began to see connections that others missed—the patterns that linked all stories together.

On his thirteenth birthday, the silver-haired woman was gone, leaving only a note: "The Library is yours now, Keeper. Find the next listener when the time comes."

And so Miso became the guardian of forgotten tales, preserving the magic that the world had nearly lost—one story at a time.
